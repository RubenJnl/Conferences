## [Charlie Owen](https://twitter.com/sonniesedge) – All Constraints are Beautiful
Constraints are everywhere. Not just people but also technology.
For example low battery, screen size/type.
Even small things can be a disability, think about colourblindness, prescription glasses or even a temporarily disability like a broken bone.
> We don't have disabled users

Over 50% of all users have at best a mid-range device. Make sure it's running smooth and fast.
> Progressive enhancement is sexy as fuck
_^^ you know wat this means_ (make it work on low-end devices)

Client side rendering break easily. HTML & CSS is robust!

> A Simple Site Is A Resilient Site
Does it need to be resilient?
If it's not resilient will ...
... it endager the life of a user?
... it cost a user money?
... they suffer legally?
... their job be impacted?
... they time-penalised?

*Users before Engineering*

> Fuck facebook and their friends!
We know the constraints and we can do better!
