Documentation is still important, you're doing this for people that are not CSS or design specilists.


## [Jack Franklin](https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) – Components on the Web
You want to drop a component on a page, configure and it just works.
– Keep as little in you head as pissible.
Try to zoom in into the problem its a lot easier to debug.

> Remember, there's no such thing as a bad decision, only a decision made with less data then you have now.

Variable font's only gain a minimal filesize.
