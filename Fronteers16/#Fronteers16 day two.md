## Adapting to Input - [Jason Grigsby](https://twitter.com/grigs)

It's not just keyboard and mouse anymore
Touch, Multi-touch, Camera, GPS, Bluetooth (LE), compass, accelerometer, etc..
Also think about gestures & voice control.
 
How are we going to use gestures or predictive touch?

### Why should we detect touch if we don't detect mouses and keyboards?
- Mouses/keyboards can be added/removed easily.
- You can use touch the first moment and a mouse the next.

Fitts's Law
The time to aquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

Design for interaction, not input.
You're designing for user need, not a specific form factor or input.

Using a remote can be the same as using arrow keys. (you can't detect a remote).

### Abstract baseline input
Like mobile/tablet/desktop (small/medium/large)
Focus on point/select instead of tap/click
