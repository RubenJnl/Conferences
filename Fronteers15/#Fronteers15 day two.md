#Fronteers15 day two


## 1. Static Sites Go All Hollywood - Phil Hawksworth
- Styleguide should be part of your build to prevent it from becoming a zombie that's not maintained.
- use content as a service for your static site? Deploy content when created. You can also use it in you dev env.
- Why not decouple content administration from live env? This is part of content-AAS (As As Service), you can cache if you want. And you'll only need one main content environment for all your dev/test/accept/live environments.

- Tooling should help you create better code
