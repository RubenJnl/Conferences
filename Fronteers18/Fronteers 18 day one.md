No matter what design you look for, they all are very similar. #cheapshit
### Good shit
Should be Fast, loaded in seconds
Universal, everyone should be able to use it
Intuitive,
Invisible,
User-centric,
Scientific
But also should be Slow, takes time to make a connection.
Individual, should feel it's made for you.
Surprising,
Impressive,
Visionary, like the iPod.
Artistic

Be bold & brave in your campaigns, it pays off!

## [John Wilander](https://twitter.com/johnwilander) - Privacy by Default on the Web
### Privacy is about people
Giving people the right and freedom about when, how they share information.

### Cross site tracking and consequences
70+ trackers on news/gadget and other sites.
60-70% of your browsing history is outside the users control. e.g. not in your browser.
- Re-Targeted ads
- Microtargetting, targetting specific vunerable users
- High value content is losing out with cross site tracking.
