## The Landscape of Front-End Testing - [Alicia Sedlock](https://twitter.com/Aliciability)

Areas of testing Front-End
- Unit
- Integration
- Acceptance
- Visual Regression
- Performance
- Accessibility

### Unit tests
Ensures tat a small section of code works.
- Describe the group of tests
- Then the test, what should it do
- Expect a specific result
- You can use hooks to do initial stuff

Jasmini, Mocha, Chai, webdrive.io QUnit, Unit.js

### Integration tests
Takes single input and checks multiple outcomes, or the other way around.
Checks overall, make sure nothing breaks when a component is used elsewhere.

### Acceptance tests
Make sure we accomplish mayor tasks `e.g. signup`

##### Tools:
- Jasmine-integration
- Karma
- Selenium
- Nightwatch

### Visual Regression
Compares visually with screenshots.
There's no good workflow yet, it compares visually but you have to check manually which changes are correct or not.

#### Tools:
- PhantomCSS/PhantomFlow
- [Percy](percy.io) is a differ tool
- BackstopJS
- Wraith
- Webdriver.io

### Accessibility tests
Basic accessibility testing.
- a11y
- pa11y
- Chrome accessibility audit

### Performance tests
Check how fast things are rendered, how many time is spend on images.
**Tool:** perfbudget, gulp size, perf.js

### Mokneytesting! :monkey:
Test under stressful & chaotic conditions

**Tools:** Gremlins.js
Create a horde of gremlins

### Linting
Linting is awesome! :cool::sunglasses:

### Summary
It's to easy to turn linting/testing off

_Time-commitment is hard when it comes to testing._
- When doing code reviews require tests
- Make it an requirement
- Every change on an existing solution should get an test, especially when fixing a bug
